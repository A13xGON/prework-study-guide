## Description

- I was motivated to build my first website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git to better my knowledge of web developement and coding so that I can become a better coder and make a career change. I learned how HTML is the foundation of a  website, CSS helps decorate the wesbite and JavaScript is the gears and pistons behind the machine.
